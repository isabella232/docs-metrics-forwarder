This topic describes the architecture of Metrics Forwarder for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

## <a id="topology"></a>High Availability Topology

In a highly available resource configuration, Metrics Forwarder for PCF uses the following:

* Three API servers, each running the Metrics Forwarder HTTP API server and a Metron Agent.

* A Metric Forwarder Service Broker

If you want to reduce the number of VMs used in the deployment, you can scale down the Metrics Forwarder API resources to 1.

## <a id="metrics"></a>Metric Types

Metrics Forwarder for PCF supports two types of metrics:

* **Gauge**. A gauge metric is a 64-bit float value. 

* **Counter**. A counter metric is a 64-bit integer. used to represent incrementing and decrementing counts. Metrics Forwarder does not increment or decrement the value of a counter metric.

## <a id="rate-limiting"></a>Rate Limiting

Metrics Forwarder for PCF enables operators to configure rate limits. You can set the number of HTTP requests and metrics that a bound app is allowed to send to Metrics Forwarder per minute. This increases the level of service reliability and prevents apps from overwhelming Loggregator with high volumes of metrics data.

Metrics Forwarder for PCF applies rate limits to all requests received by the Metrics Forwarder API. The following HTTP headers are present in each response from the Metrics Forwarder API.

<table class="nice">
    <th>HTTP Header</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <tr>
        <td><code>x-ratelimit-limit</code></td>
        <td>Total number of HTTP requests that a bound app is allowed to send per minute. See <code>x-ratelimit-period</code>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>x-ratelimit-metrics-limit</code></td>
        <td>Total number of metrics that a bound app is allowed to send per minute. See <code>x-ratelimit-period</code>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>x-ratelimit-metrics-remaining</code></td>
        <td>Remaining number of metrics that a bound app can send during the current 60-second interval. See <code>x-ratelimit-retry-after</code>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>x-ratelimit-period</code></td>
        <td>60-second interval during which all limits are applied.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>x-ratelimit-remaining</code></td>
        <td>Remaining number of HTTP requests that a bound app can send during the current 60-second interval. See <code>x-ratelimit-retry-after</code>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>x-ratelimit-retry-after</code></td>
        <td>Number of seconds remaining until the current one-minute interval ends.<code></code></td>
    </tr>
</table>

The following example applies to the default Unlimited plan.

```
x-ratelimit-limit →unlimited
x-ratelimit-metrics-limit →unlimited
x-ratelimit-metrics-remaining →unlimited
x-ratelimit-period →60
x-ratelimit-remaining →unlimited
x-ratelimit-retry-after →0
```
