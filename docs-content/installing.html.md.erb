### Service Plans and Rate Limiting

Service plans enable operators to configure the rate limiting settings that apply to metrics emitted to the Metrics Forwarder service. By default, a single service plan is configured with unlimited requests and metrics. For more information, see [Rate Limiting](architecture.html#rate-limiting).

Determining the capacity of [Loggregator](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-11/loggregator/log-ops-guide.html) can help you to decide what service plans to configure.
