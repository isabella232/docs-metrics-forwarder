### Service Plans and Rate Limiting  ###

Service Plans enable an operator to configure the rate limiting settings that apply to metrics emitted to the Metrics Forwarder service.   By default a single service plan is configured with unlimited requests and metrics.

To understand more about rate limiting see : LINK TO RATE LIMITING IN ARCHITECTURE

To determine what service plans to configure you can determine the capacity of Loggregator in the Loggregator documentation.
