The API can be accessed directly and metrics can be emitted directly by submiting an HTTP POST request to the API.  

For convenience, a framework or library will help in controlling the frequency of metric emission, error handling, aggregation and general API use.

A few examples of frameworks that assist in emitting metrics to Metrics Forwarderfor PCF service: 

## <a id='spring-boot-actuators'></a>Spring Boot Acuator

  1. Configure App to use Spring Boot Actuators
  1. Create Metrics Forward for PCF Service
  1. Bind to Metrics Forwarder for PCF Service
  1. Push or Restage your app.
    1. Use the latest java buildpack or at least 4.2
