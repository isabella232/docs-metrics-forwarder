This topic explains how to monitor the health of Metrics Forwarder for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) using the logs and metrics generated by Metrics Forwarder for PCF component VMs and Loggregator.

For general information about logging and metrics in PCF, see [Logging and Metrics](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/loggregator/index.html).

The Metron Agent(s) associated with the Metrics Forwarder service emits logs and metrics. You can use this data to identify health issues related to trasmitting logs through Loggregator.

In addition, the sum and count of all metrics transmitted by Metrics Forwarder helps to monitor changes in the use of the Metrics Forwarder service.
