This topic explains how to monitor the health of the Metrics Forwarder for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) service using the logs and metrics generated by Metrics Forwarder for PCF component VMs and loggregator.

For general information about logging and metrics in PCF, see [Logging and Metrics](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/loggregator/index.html).

## <a id="metrics"></a>About Metrics

Metrics are regularly-generated log messages that report measured component states. The Metron Agent(s) associated with the Metrics Forwarder service emits logs and metrics that indicate health issues related to trasmitting logs through Loggregator.

The sum/count of all metrics transmitted by the Metrics Forwarder is another valuable metric that will help indicate any changes in the use (and potentially health) of the Metrics Forwarder service.
