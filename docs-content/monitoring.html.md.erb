This topic explains how to monitor the health of the Metrics Forwarder for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) service using the logs, metrics, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) generated by Metrics Forwarder for PCF component VMs and loggregator.

For general information about logging and metrics in PCF, see [Logging and Metrics](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/loggregator/index.html).

## <a id="metrics"></a>About Metrics

Metrics are regularly-generated log messages that report measured component states. The metrics polling interval is 30 seconds for MySQL instances and 60 seconds for the service broker.


## <a id="kpi"></a>Key Performance Indicators

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for MySQL for PCF are metrics that operators find most useful for monitoring their MySQL service to ensure smooth operation. KPIs are high-signal-value metrics that can indicate emerging issues. KPIs can be raw component metrics or _derived_ metrics generated by applying formulas to raw metrics.

Pivotal provides the following KPIs as general alerting and response guidance for typical MySQL for PCF installations.
Pivotal recommends that operators continue to fine-tune the alert measures to their installation by observing historical trends.
Pivotal also recommends that operators expand beyond this guidance and create new, installation-specific monitoring
metrics, thresholds, and alerts based on learning from their own installations.
