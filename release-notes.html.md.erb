This topic contains release notes for Metrics Forwarder for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

## <a id="1-11"></a>v1.11.0

**Release Date:** September 20, 2017

### Features

* Custom app metrics HTTP API.
* Metric emission rate limiting.
* HA Metrics Forwarder API with configurable capacity.

### Known Issues

* Service Broker is not HA.
* Rate limiting in an HA configuration (default) is susceptible to inaccuracy due to load balancing across API instances.
* If you make the system domain in the `system` org private, Metrics Forwarder for PCF does not run. Metrics Forwarder for PCF fails to push apps needed for smoke tests without a public system domain.
