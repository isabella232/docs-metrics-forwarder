## <a id="111-4"></a>v1.11.4
**Release Date:** December 3, 2018

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change</strong>: Metrics Forwarder for PCF v1.11.4 and later requires a Xenial stemcell.

You must manually download and import a new stemcell into the Ops Manager Stemcell Library before deploying Metrics Forwarder for PCF v1.11.4.

This might break automation you have set up to update Metrics Forwarder for PCF deployments that used Trusty stemcells. 

To download the Xenial stemcell from Pivotal Network,
go to <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-ubuntu-xenial"> Stemcells for PCF (Ubuntu Xenial)</a>.
For instructions on updating BOSH add-ons and importing the stemcell, see <a href="./installing.html">Installing and Configuring Metrics Forwarder for PCF</a>.</p>

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* Addresses [CVE-2018-15759](https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2018-15759) by upgrading to the latest Broker API
* Uses the Loggregator agent rather than the Metron agent

### Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

* Service Broker is not HA.
* Rate limiting in an HA configuration (default) is susceptible to inaccuracy due to load balancing across API instances.
* If you make the system domain in the `system` org private, Metrics Forwarder for PCF fails to push apps needed for its smoke tests.
* Smoke tests fail on AWS.
